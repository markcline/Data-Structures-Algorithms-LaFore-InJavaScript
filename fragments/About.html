<h2>Data-Structures-Algorithms-LaFore-InJavaScript</h2>
I'm currently reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-Edition/dp/0672324539">Data Structures & Algorithms in Java</a> by LaFore to refresh my technical knowledge. At the same time, I've been refreshing my javascript skills, so as practice, I am converting all the examples in the book to work in Javascript.

A few words:

    <ul>

<li>Since the book is teaching the basics, the examples look this way as well. You might look at it and say (why are you doing these things - javascript supports X natively!). That's not the point since this is a learning exercise</li>

<li>I'm trying to keep the examples relatively close to the book while converting to javascript syntax, so it's not intended to be best practices</li>

<li>I'm trying to use core javascript as much as possible, but sometimes things are just soo much easier in JQuery that I use that</li>

<li>I avoided using a MV* framework (like backbone or Angular) for now, since the goal is to focus on the lessons + learning Javascript. I realize there isn't proper separation of concerns between business logic and UI for this reason. Feel free to port over to a framework, but realize that it will begin to match the book less and less.</li>
</ul>
