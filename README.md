# Data-Structures-Algorithms-LaFore-InJavaScript
I'm currently reading the book [Data Structures & Algorithms in Java by LaFore](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-Edition/dp/0672324539) to refresh my technical knowledge.  At the same time, I've been refreshing my javascript skills, so as practice, I am converting all the examples in the book to work in Javascript.

A few words:

+ Since the book is teaching the basics, the examples look this way as well. You might look at it and say (why are you doing these things - javascript supports X natively!). That's not the point since this is a learning exercise

+ I'm trying to keep the examples relatively close to the book while converting to javascript syntax, so it's not intended to be best practices

+ I'm trying to use core javascript as much as possible, but sometimes things are just soo much easier in JQuery that I use that

+ I avoided using a MV* framework (like backbone or Angular) for now, since the goal is to focus on the lessons + learning Javascript. I realize there isn't proper separation of concerns between business logic and UI for this reason.  Feel free to port over to a framework, but realize that it will begin to match the book less and less.

+ I'm not currently using requireJS just to keep things a little simpler

+ I'm using some limited bootstrap for styling

Hope you like it - feel free to add comments/commits!
